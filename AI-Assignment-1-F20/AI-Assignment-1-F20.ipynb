    "We've studied two types of search algorithms during the recent lectures: Uninformed Search and Informed Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uninformed Search (aka blind search) refers to the search strategies that do not use additional information about states and goal of the search - nothing beyond the provided problem definition. The first algorithms that we studied from Chapter 3 of the Russel & Norvig textbook were Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) which both fall into the category of Uniformed Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also studied how we can modify DFS to combine the advantages of BFS (completeness and conditional optimality) with the main advantage of DFS --space complexity of $O(bm)$ where $b$ is the branching factor and $m$ is the maximum depth of the search space. Limited Depth Search and Iterative Deepening DFS were two algorithms that we studied in that section and you are going to use them in Part I of this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part II, you are going to practice Informed Search algorithms and heuristic functions. As discussed in the lectures, informed search algorithms use heuristic functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in Part III, you will work on an example graph by applying Informed Search algorithms: Greedy Best-First Search and A*. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Very Important Note:</b> Read ALL the instructions in this notebook very carefully. Careless reading and skipping lines would be a major source of making mistakes and losing points in your first assignment! Also notice that this assignment has three parts and includes multiple steps and questions. You're strongly recommended to get started early and plan to finish well before the due. Technical problems or other issues/questions on the due date or just a day before would NOT be accepted as an excuse to delay your submission. As stated in the policy, ALL assignments are indvidual work and students are strictly prohibited from collaboration on assignments. Students are responsible to debug the code and resolve any errors that may arise. Students should NOT share any answer, solution, or code/snippet in Piazza. Violations of these policies would be penalized accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pedagogically, this assignment will help you:\n",
    "- better understand how these algorithms work in pratice. \n",
    "- brush up your Python skills - and possibly learn a couple of new \"Pythonic\" tricks!\n",
